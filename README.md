# E-Commerce Web Application

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application developed with **Next.js 14+** and **TailwindCSS**, leveraging **MongoDB** for data storage and **JWT** for secure authentication. Key features include product management, user authentication, real-time updates, and a responsive design.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and login functionality with JWT for secure sessions.
- **Product Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete products with real-time updates on the dashboard.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with TailwindCSS for a clean, responsive interface.
- **Server Actions**: Real-time CRUD operations using Next.js Server Actions and MongoDB.
- **Search Functionality**: Efficient search for products by name from the Navbar.
- **Pagination**: Products are paginated on the dashboard to improve loading performance.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd e-commerce-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following credentials:

```plaintext
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://admin321:admin321@cluster0.gjyfd.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
JWT_SECRET=rb&aQi~lo^6kbb-8_JkGGi*G1_6o],yWEy=|I+u?%S:xfp&ZLlyGrKxz).XH}<,
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Implementation Choices

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14+**: Chosen for its powerful server-rendering capabilities, which improve SEO and load times for an e-commerce application.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database ideal for managing product information with flexibility.
- **JWT for Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication suitable for managing user sessions in a scalable way.
- **TailwindCSS**: For fast, utility-first styling and responsive design.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Server Actions for Real-Time Data**: Using Server Actions in Next.js for real-time CRUD operations made it possible to implement instant updates for product management.
2. **Modular Components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable components (e.g., Navbar, Dashboard) to improve readability and maintenance.
3. **Context for User State Management**: The `UserContext` and `ProductContext` handle user authentication and product state, ensuring efficient data sharing across components.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Real-Time Product Updates**:
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring products update across all views after add/edit/delete actions.
   - **Solution**: Implemented context-based state management combined with Server Actions to trigger updates and re-render components in real-time.

2. **JWT-Based Authentication**:
   - **Challenge**: Securing user sessions and managing state.
   - **Solution**: Used `js-cookie` to handle JWT tokens and implemented a `logout` function to clear cookies and local storage, enhancing security.

3. **Pagination**:
   - **Challenge**: Loading a large number of products impacted performance.
   - **Solution**: Implemented pagination on the dashboard page to limit products per page, improving load times and user experience.
